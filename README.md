# MCP 919 With Optifine
Mod Coder Pack 919 (aka Minecraft 1.8.9) with Optifine included.
Useful for those who do not know how to get MCP 919 instead of MCP 918. Optifine included for performance.
No changes are made. Just set the workspace directory to the eclipse folder and you are ready to go! (you do need to set up a library though)
